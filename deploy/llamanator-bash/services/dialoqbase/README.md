# Dialoqbase

Dialoqbase is an open-source application designed to facilitate the creation of custom chatbots using a personalized knowledge base. The application leverages advanced language models to generate accurate and context-aware responses. Additionally, it utilizes PostgreSQL, a robust relational database management system, for efficient vector search operations and for storing the knowledge base.

## Using Dialoqbase with Llamanator

Once you have Dialoqbase up and running, you can login using `admin` and `admin` as the default credentials.

Once logged in, you will need to add the Ollama endpoint to the setting page and choose a model for chat and embeddings. We recommend using `mistral` for chat and `nomic-embed-text` for embeddings.
